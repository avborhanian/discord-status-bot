Quick implementation of searching history and logging.

Current limitations:
- Don't have a way to determine others who actually played automatically
    - We could instead watch the people in the discord, and when the game play status changes in some way, check then.
- Remove unwraps so we handle errors gracefully, instead of crashing.
- There's a bug where we have discord users not being removed. Might need to add better tracking to figure out why.
